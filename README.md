This repository is devoted to the study of the quantum Grover algorithm, its implementation, performance analysis, and possible problems in application. It contains theoretical materials, code to simulate the algorithm, and examples of use. The main goal is to reveal the potential and limitations of the Grover algorithm in the context of quantum computing.
